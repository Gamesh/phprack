phpRack v0.1, Integration Testing Framework

We are pleased to introduce [url=http://www.phprack.com]phpRack[/url], a unique open-source product, aimed to simplify integration of your web products into production environment. You develop integration tests in a way similar to unit tests. Then you deploy them to the production server and phpRack executes them for you in a manual or an automated mode:

To recap, phpRack allows you:

- to execute tests in production environment
- to start/stop tests manually and review results in browser
- to execute all tests in a suite and receive summary report by email
- to restrict access to the testing panel, by password
- to exploit pre-defined adapters for testing of major server components, incl. databases, file system, CPU parameters, PEAR packages, PHP engine, etc
- to hook integration testing process to your continuous integration cycle
- to execute test suite from Phing
- to test both the server environment and your source code there

phpRack is suitable for projects of any size, from small one-page personal web sites to enterprise applications. We're looking forward your comments and suggestions. Thanks in advance for your attention to our product!
